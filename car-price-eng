# Data

The service for the sale of used cars is developing an application to attract new customers. It allows customers to quickly find out the market value of their cars. 
The following historical data are available: technical characteristics, configuration and prices of cars. A model have to be built to determine the cost of the car.

The following model parameters are important:

- prediction quality;
- prediction speed;
- training time.

# Task 

Build a model to determine car cost based on historical data on technical characteristics, configuration and prices of cars

The following conditions should be followed:

- The RMSE metric is used to assess the quality of models.
- As a start should try a few simple models.
- Then proceed to Gradient boosting using the Catboost and Light GBL libraries.

# Main stages
