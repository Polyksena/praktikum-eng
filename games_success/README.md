# Data

The online store sells computer games all over the world. Historical data of game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms are available from open sources.

The project has data up to 2016, and I have to plan a campaign for 2017. I have to develope the principle of working with data, which can be applied in any other year.

# Task 

Identify and analyze the most successful games. To identify the factors that determine the commercial success of the game, with this information the company will be able to plan an advertising budget for the next year. For this puppose I studied data on game sales by platforms, genres, regions and user ratings.

There are also two hypotheses to be tested:

- The average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
- Average user ratings of Action and Sport genres are different

# Main stages  

1. Exploring general project information 
2. Data preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis with visualization
4. Creating user profile by regions
5. Hypothesis testing

# Used libraries

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- SciPy
