| Project | Description | Used libraries and tools |
| :--------------- | :------- | :--------- |
| [Machine Learning model for a industrial enterprise](https://github.com/Polyksena/praktikum-eng/tree/main/gold_recovery_eng) | Developed a model predicting the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. The model helped to optimize production in order not to launch a plant with unprofitable characteristics. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Sklearn, data analysis, exploratory data analysis, regression, custom metrics|
| [Predicting taxi orders number]() | Built a Machine Learning model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. | Python, Pandas, Sklearn, statsmodels, time series, regression |
| [Predicting the churn of telecom operator customers]() | Analysis of the mobile operator customers and developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn | Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, NumPy, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data preprocessing, gradient boosting |
